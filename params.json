{"body":"# Music \r\n\r\nThis application is a fairly simple one. Below is a high-level description.\r\n\r\n## High-Level Description\r\n\r\n### HTML\r\nFirst off, we should set up divs for each note on the Piano. Since a piano has 88 keys (52 white keys and 36 black keys - covering a little over 7 octaves) I think it would be overkill if we made the entire piano. Hence, just to get the idea, we will create a simple piano, covering only a little over one octave, starting at middle C.\r\n\r\nThis means that we will need 14 divs for the notes (Middle C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C, C#)\r\n\r\nWe will create another div to encompass all the notes on the piano. \r\n\r\nLastly, we will create one div to display all the notes which the user hovers over. \r\n\r\n### CSS\r\nIn our .css file, we will colour the notes appropriately - making the #'s black and the naturals white. The # keys must be shorted than the white keys - which is also something we will account for. Here is what our .css. Out style sheet will also be required to overlap the # and naturals, placing the # keys on top of the natural keys. \r\n\r\n### JAVASCRIPT\r\nOur Javascript code will be very straightforward. We will need one function to handle onmouseover events and pass the appropriate key name to another function which will be used to display the notes on the webpage. \r\n\r\n\r\n ","note":"Don't delete this file!
